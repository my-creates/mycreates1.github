        <p>I want to introduce myself in a different light. My name is Maya and I am 24.</p>
        <p>I really love to draw, code, take pictures, and crochet. Honestly, I feel like you should 
            know me differently. I'm not just a resume, I am a person with a lot of personality.
        </p>
        <p>I have a lot of things that I love. Personally, I love to eat and to take pictures. I like to 
            design things on t-shirts and as stickers. I love having creative freedom. My life as a creative
            person has heavily shaped my need to create. I really love making things and this brings me to 
            creating websites. I get to fully show my personality this way.
        </p>
        <p>I love to crochet, it started out to help my anxiety but it graduated into something I 
            just like to do. I even made a business out of it. I began drawing when I was in middle school
            as an outlet. I have developed a cutesy style that is forever changing. 
        </p>
        <p>I am currently into a lot of animes the main one being Toilet Bound Hanako-kun. I love video games, my
            favourite part would have to be seeing the graphics. I love the graphics in any games. Also, if you 
            couldn't tell from the layout, my favourite color is pink!
